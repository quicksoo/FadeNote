# FadeNote

FadeNote is a lightweight desktop note app built around a single idea:

> **Most notes are temporary.**

Not everything you write needs to be kept forever. Thoughts fade, tasks expire, context changes — and your notes should be allowed to disappear naturally.

FadeNote lives quietly on your desktop, helping you capture what matters *now*, without turning into long‑term clutter.

## Core Philosophy

### Notes are ephemeral by default

In FadeNote, notes are not meant to be managed, organized, or archived forever.

* You write them.
* You use them.
* If they are no longer touched, they fade away.

Forgetting is not a bug — it is a feature.

### Permanence is a conscious choice

If a note truly matters, you can **Pin** it.

* Pinned notes never disappear.
* Everything else is temporary.

This makes permanence intentional, not accidental.

### The desktop is the context

FadeNote avoids folders, notebooks, and complex structures.

* Each note is its own window.
* Notes live directly on your desktop.
* Position and size are part of how you think.

Your screen becomes your workspace.

## Key Features

* Lightweight, distraction‑free notes
* Pin notes to keep them forever
* Auto‑fade for temporary thoughts
* Always‑on‑top support for focus

## What FadeNote Is Not

* A knowledge base
* A task manager
* A markdown editor
* A long‑term note archive

FadeNote is intentionally minimal.

It is designed for *thinking*, not *organizing*.

---

## When FadeNote Works Best

* Temporary reminders
* Things you need today or this week
* Half‑formed ideas
* Scratch notes during work

If a note survives long enough to be pinned, it has earned its place.

---

FadeNote is not about saving everything.

It’s about letting most things fade — and keeping only what truly matters.
